        <h1>HTML5 and How It Works?</h1>
        <p>Well if you want to step into the web developer world, the first thing we start with is <b>HTML</b> which is
            also
            known as the <b>World Wide Web's</b> core markup language. HTML is also known as HyperText Markup Language
            and was
            launched in <b>1993</b> and it is still the standard markup language for the documents that we display in
            our web
            browsers.
            And we can further go ahead and add <b>Cascading Style Sheets</b> "CSS" and as well as <b>JavaScript</b> to
            make our web
            pages more beautiful and interactive.</p>
        <p>The HTML provides the basic foundation and structure of the web pages. Since all the web browsers, like
            <b>Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari</b>, etc receives the HTML documents from different <b>web servers</b> and
            our browsers
            render all the information on our browser window.</p>
        <p>All right, so let's see how this works. The <b>HTML documents</b> have small building blocks called HTML
            elements,
            like <b> &lthead&gt, &lttitle&gt, &ltbody&gt,</b> etc.
            These elements join together and form the document that will be later rendered. Almost all the elements of
            HTML have an <b>opening tag</b> and a <b>closing tag</b> excluding a few like <b>&ltbr&gt, &lthr&gt</b>, etc
        </p>

        <h2>HTML5 Semantic vs Non-Semantic Elements!</h2>

        <p>If we count the <b>number of tags</b> in HTML5, currently there are approximately <b>111 supported tags</b>
            <em>(Reference Mozilla Developer Network)</em>.
            And out of these, we have further two types of elements via, Semantic Elements
            and Non-Semantic Elements.</p>

        <p>As the name says, <b>sematic elements</b> simply describe elements that have a clear <b>meaning</b>. It helps
            us make the
            HTML document more <b>readable and meaningful</b> by allowing us to define the various sections of our web
            page. On
            the other hand, non-semantic elements do not define the meaning or content of the element. It makes it hard
            to read and work.</p>

        <p>Some of the good <b>examples</b> of semantic elements are &ltform&gt, &lttable&gt, &ltheader&gt,
            &ltfooter&gt,
            &ltarticle&gt, &ltaside&gt, etc. As it
            has a meaning, we know a <b>&ltnav&gt</b> will have the <b>Navigation</b> and will be placed on the top.
            Similarly, a
            Footer
            will have the links to contact and will be placed at the end of the webpage. And the simple examples of
            non-semantic elements are &ltdiv&gt, &ltspan&gt and it does not define the type of content to be stored. It
            can
            contain a set of paragraphs or a couple of images.</p>

        <h2>Example of Semantic HTML</h2>
        <figure>
            <img src="navsemantic.png">
            <img src="nonsemantic.png">
        </figure>
        <p>In both the examples we created a <b>navigation bar</b>, however, if we look at the first image, we have used
            a <b>nav</b>
            tag which is a semantic element and we can simply read it. On the other hand, we have created the same
            navbar but used a <b>div</b> tag which is a non-semantic element, and gave a <b>class = "nav"</b>. This is a
            bad practice.
            Similarly, we can create a footer using a footer tag or a div, although it will be good to follow semantics
            and use a footer tag.
        </p>
        <h2>Some commonly used Semantic Elements</h2>
        <p>&ltheader&gt - Defines a header of some particular section or document.</p>
        <p>&ltfigure&gt - Defines content like, images, photos, etc.</p>
        <p>&ltfigcaption&gt - Defines a caption for a figure element.</p>
        <p>&ltsection&gt- Defines a section of a document.</p>
